Run trivy with Docker CLI inside container
This mounts the Docker socket from your host into the container.
It gives the Trivy container access to your host's Docker daemon.
This command runs a temporary Trivy container that scans your spoonacular-app Docker image, prints the results, and then deletes itself.
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock aquasec/trivy image spoonacular-app:latest
.
