Examples of filtering:
1) @GetMapping("/filter")
public ResponseEntity<List<Recipe>> filterRecipes(
        @RequestParam(required = false) Integer maxPrepTime,
        @RequestParam(required = false) String dietType,  // e.g., Vegan, Gluten-Free, etc.
        @RequestParam(required = false) Integer maxCalories)

2) Meal Planning
Users can plan meals by selecting recipes for specific days of the week or times of the day (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner).
You can save these plans in the database and allow users to retrieve them later.

3) Generate a Shopping List
 Once users have selected their meal plans, you can aggregate the ingredients needed across all recipes and generate a shopping list.
